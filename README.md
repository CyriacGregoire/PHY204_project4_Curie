# PHY204_project4_Curie
This is the github repository for our PHY204 project on Curie's Paramagnetism. The repository contains only a Jupyter Notebook and some data files that allow to directly recover the graphs presented in both our report and our defense. Should one wish to recreate some results, the whole notebook must simply be run. Note that this may take some time. Downloading the data files is not necessary.
